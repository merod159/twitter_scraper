The goal of my project is to search through 4 of the biggest news media outlets' most recent tweets. Along with the text of the tweets themselves, I also pull the ID number, number of retweets and number of likes. After I sum up each news media's overall likes and retweets I decided that I would do a brief word search on each csv. The words I chose are some of the most commone that you will see in any of today's media. For example 'Trump' is a term that pops up on every new feed, every day. By pairing this information togther I can get a sense of how far specific articles are going/getting spread based off of what their topics are, as well as retweet and likes. One thing to keep in mind though is that "correlation does not imply causation"

To run the project simply type "bash run.sh" and everything will run and dump the results into a results.txt file, which will be in plain text.

The flow of the projects is as follows, tweet_getter.py starts by pulling around 3300 of the latest tweets from each media source. It then dumps each of them into their own .csv files. Next word_search.sh uses a mix of grep and sed to find the likes, retweet, and word pattern counts from each csv. Since it is run inside of run.sh, I was able to have it dump all text output into results.txt where the user can read them.
