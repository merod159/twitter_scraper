The goal of this project is to be able to identify how far the effect of a new article may travel through its readers. I will be using a data set of hand picked articles, half that are true and half that are fake or "clickbait". Once the articles are identified I will be using the Twitter API and unixtools to scrap and crawl through comments and likes under the article. I will then go to the user's profile and see if they are tweeting about the article on their own, and if so, how are their followers interacting with them.
